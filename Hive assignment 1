1. Download vechile sales data -> https://github.com/shashank-mishra219/Hive-Class/blob/main/sales_order_data.csv


2. Store raw data into hdfs location
abc@d860a252aa04:~/workspace$ hadoop fs -put SALES_ORDER.csv /tmp

3. Create a internal hive table "sales_order_csv" which will store csv data sales_order_csv .. make sure to skip header row while creating table
create table sales_order_csv
    (
    ordernumber int,
    QUANTITYORDERED int,
    PRICEEACH int,
    ORDERLINENUMBER int,
    sales int,
    STATUS string,
    QTR_ID int,
    MONTH_ID int,
    year_id int,
    PRODUCTLINE string,
    MSRP int,
    PRODUCTCODE string,
    PHONE string,
    city string,
    state string,
    pomst string,
    country string,
    TERRITORY string,
    CONTACTLASTNAME string,
    CONTACTFIRSTNAME string,
    DEALSIZE string
    )
    row format delimited
    fields terminated by ',';
    
4. Load data from hdfs path into "sales_order_csv" 
load data inpath '/tmp/SALES_ORDER.csv' into table sales_order_csv;

5. Create an internal hive table which will store data in ORC format "sales_order_orc"
create table sales_order_orc
    (
    ordernumber int,
    QUANTITYORDERED int,
    PRICEEACH int,
    ORDERLINENUMBER int,
    sales int,
    STATUS string,
    QTR_ID int,
    MONTH_ID int,
    year_id int,
    PRODUCTLINE string,
    MSRP int,
    PRODUCTCODE string,
    PHONE string,
    city string,
    state string,
    pomst string,
    country string,
    TERRITORY string,
    CONTACTLASTNAME string,
    CONTACTFIRSTNAME string,
    DEALSIZE string
    )
    stored as orc;

6. Load data from "sales_order_csv" into "sales_order_orc"
from sales_order_csv insert overwrite table sales_order_orc select *;

Perform below menioned queries on "sales_order_orc" table :

a. Calculatye total sales per year
select year_id,count(sales) over(partition by year_id) from sales_order_csv;
b. Find a product for which maximum orders were placed
c. Calculate the total sales for each quarter
d. In which quarter sales was minimum
e. In which country sales was maximum and in which country sales was minimum
f. Calculate quartelry sales for each city
h. Find a month for each year in which maximum number of quantities were sold
