1. Download vechile sales data -> https://github.com/shashank-mishra219/Hive-Class/blob/main/sales_order_data.csv


2. Store raw data into hdfs location
abc@d860a252aa04:~/workspace$ hadoop fs -put SALES_ORDER.csv /tmp

3. Create a internal hive table "sales_order_csv" which will store csv data sales_order_csv .. make sure to skip header row while creating table
create table sales_order_csv
    (
    ordernumber int,
    QUANTITYORDERED int,
    PRICEEACH int,
    ORDERLINENUMBER int,
    sales int,
    STATUS string,
    QTR_ID int,
    MONTH_ID int,
    year_id int,
    PRODUCTLINE string,
    MSRP int,
    PRODUCTCODE string,
    PHONE string,
    city string,
    state string,
    pomst string,
    country string,
    TERRITORY string,
    CONTACTLASTNAME string,
    CONTACTFIRSTNAME string,
    DEALSIZE string
    )
    row format delimited
    fields terminated by ',';
    
4. Load data from hdfs path into "sales_order_csv" 
load data inpath '/tmp/SALES_ORDER.csv' into table sales_order_csv;

5. Create an internal hive table which will store data in ORC format "sales_order_orc"
create table sales_order_orc
    (
    ordernumber int,
    QUANTITYORDERED int,
    PRICEEACH int,
    ORDERLINENUMBER int,
    sales int,
    STATUS string,
    QTR_ID int,
    MONTH_ID int,
    year_id int,
    PRODUCTLINE string,
    MSRP int,
    PRODUCTCODE string,
    PHONE string,
    city string,
    state string,
    pomst string,
    country string,
    TERRITORY string,
    CONTACTLASTNAME string,
    CONTACTFIRSTNAME string,
    DEALSIZE string
    )
    stored as orc;

6. Load data from "sales_order_csv" into "sales_order_orc"
from sales_order_csv insert overwrite table sales_order_orc select *;

Perform below menioned queries on "sales_order_orc" table :

a. Calculatye total sales per year
select year_id, sum(sales) over(partition by year_id) from sales_order_csv;

b. Find a product for which maximum orders were placed
Select max(QUANTITYORDERED) ,PRODUCTLINE from sales_order_csv group by QUANTITYORDERED;

c. Calculate the total sales for each quarter
Select sum(sales),QTR_ID FROM sales_order_csv
GROUP BY QTR_ID;

d. In which quarter sales was minimum

select QTR_ID from (
Select MIN(sales) sls, QTR_ID FROM sales_order_csv
GROUP BY QTR_ID
ORDER BY sls
limit 1)A;

e. In which country sales was maximum and in which country sales was minimum

Select country from (Select sum(sales) sls,country from sales_order_csv 
group by country
order by sls desc
limit 1)a
union 
Select country from (Select sum(sales) sls,country from sales_order_csv 
group by country
order by sls
limit 1)b

f. Calculate quartelry sales for each city
SELECT SUM(SALES),QTR_ID,CITY FROM sales_order_csv
GROUP BY CITY,QTR_ID;

h. Find a month for each year in which maximum number of quantities were sold
SELECT MONTH_ID,YEAR_ID FROM (
Select MONTH_ID,YEAR_ID,MAX(SALES) SLS FROM sales_order_csv
GROUP BY MONTH_ID,year_id
ORDER BY SLS DESC)A
GROUP BY MONTH_ID,YEAR_ID;
