load data inpath '/tmp/Parking.csv' into table Parking;


Part-I: Examine the data

1.) Find the total number of tickets for the year.
select count(*) from Parking where Issue_date like '%2018';   >>>526941

2.) Find out how many unique states the cars which got parking tickets came from.
select count(distinct Registration_State) from Parking ;   >>> 65

3.) Some parking tickets donâ€™t have addresses on them, which is cause for concern. Find out how many such tickets there are(i.e. tickets where either "Street Code 1" or "Street Code 2" or "Street Code 3" is empty )
select count(*) from Parking where Street_Code1 is null or Street_Code2 is null or Street_Code3 is null;   >>>1

Part-II: Aggregation tasks

1.) How often does each violation code occur? (frequency of violation codes - find the top 5)
select * from 
(Select count(*) count ,violation_code from Parking group by Violation_Code )a
order by count desc
limit 5;

95651   38
94684   21
87064   36
71606   14
67779   20


2.) How often does each vehicle body type get a parking ticket? How about the vehicle make? (find the top 5 for both)
3.) A precinct is a police station that has a certain zone of the city under its command. Find the (5 highest) frequencies of:
      a.) Violating Precincts (this is the precinct of the zone where the violation occurred)
      b.) Issuer Precincts (this is the precinct that issued the ticket)
4.) Find the violation code frequency across 3 precincts which have issued the most number of tickets - do these precinct zones have an exceptionally high frequency of certain violation codes?
5.) Find out the properties of parking violations across different times of the day: The Violation Time field is specified in a strange format. Find a way to make this into a time attribute that you can use to divide into groups.
6.) Divide 24 hours into 6 equal discrete bins of time. The intervals you choose are at your discretion. For each of these groups, find the 3 most commonly occurring violations
