load data inpath '/tmp/Parking.csv' into table Parking;


Part-I: Examine the data

1.) Find the total number of tickets for the year.
select count(*) from Parking where Issue_date like '%2018';   >>>526941

2.) Find out how many unique states the cars which got parking tickets came from.
select count(distinct Registration_State) from Parking ;   >>> 65

3.) Some parking tickets donâ€™t have addresses on them, which is cause for concern. Find out how many such tickets there are(i.e. tickets where either "Street Code 1" or "Street Code 2" or "Street Code 3" is empty )
select count(*) from Parking where Street_Code1 is null or Street_Code2 is null or Street_Code3 is null;   >>>1

Part-II: Aggregation tasks

1.) How often does each violation code occur? (frequency of violation codes - find the top 5)
select * from 
(Select count(*) count ,violation_code from Parking group by Violation_Code )a
order by count desc
limit 5;

95651   38
94684   21
87064   36
71606   14
67779   20

 2.) How often does each vehicle body type get a parking ticket? How about the vehicle make? (find the top 5 for both)
select * from
(Select count(*) count ,Vehicle_Body_Type from Parking group by Vehicle_Body_Type )a
order by count desc
limit 5;

292851  SUBN
231069  4DSD
120199  VAN
49744   DELV
22301   PICK

select * from
(Select count(*) count ,Vehicle_Make  from Parking group by Vehicle_Make )a
order by count desc
limit 5;

102078  FORD
93586   TOYOT
82259   HONDA
70537   NISSA
53376   CHEVR

3.) A precinct is a police station that has a certain zone of the city under its command. Find the (5 highest) frequencies of:
      a.) Violating Precincts (this is the precinct of the zone where the violation occurred)
     
    select * from
(Select count(*) count, Violation_Precinct from Parking group by Violation_Precinct )a
order by count desc
limit 5;

127545  0
42057   19
29745   14
29446   1
23485   18

      b.) Issuer Precincts (this is the precinct that issued the ticket)

select * from
(Select count(*) count, Issuer_Precinct from Parking group by Issuer_Precinct )a
order by count desc
limit 5;

143143  0
41159   19
29061   14
28554   1
22448   18

4.) Find the violation code frequency across 3 precincts which have issued the most number of tickets - 
do these precinct zones have an exceptionally high frequency of certain violation codes?
select * from
(Select count(*) count, Violation_Code  from Parking where Issuer_Precinct =19 group by Violation_Code)a
order by count desc
limit 3;
a.count a.violation_code
5717    46
4492    38
4055    37

select * from
(Select count(*) count, Violation_Code  from Parking where Issuer_Precinct =14 group by Violation_Code)a
order by count desc
limit 3;



select * from
(Select count(*) count, Violation_Code  from Parking where Issuer_Precinct =01 group by Violation_Code)a
order by count desc
limit 3;
5.) Find out the properties of parking violations across different times of the day: The Violation Time field is specified in a strange format. Find a way to make this into a time attribute that you can use to divide into groups.
6.) Divide 24 hours into 6 equal discrete bins of time. The intervals you choose are at your discretion. For each of these groups, find the 3 most commonly occurring violations
